Emotion-aware Personalized Music Recommendation with a Heterogeneity-aware Deep Bayesian Network


~~We will make the constructed dataset public after the paper is accepted.~~ $\rightarrow$ ~~The dataset is coming. We are now preparing the data files. The full dataset can be accessible within two days.~~ $\rightarrow$
EmoMusicLJ and EmoMusicLJ-small (excluding audio files) have all been uploaded. The audio files are large, so we will package them and upload them to a cloud drive. The link to the cloud drive will be provided later. Please take a look at README-data.md for detailed file descriptions.

Friendly reminder: Please do not use the music audio from the dataset for commercial purposes or to gain any non-academic benefits. Thank you very much.

Note: The data is uploaded after reorganization, and there may be data path changes. If you encounter a path error when running the code, please configure the path correctly according to the directory list.

We would be honored if you used the code or datasets in this article, and please also cite our paper in the following format:
